{-| This module is a wrapper around the [Socket](Phoenix.Socket),
[Channel](Phoenix.Channel) and [Presence](Phoenix.Presence) modules. It handles
all the low level stuff with a simple, but extensive API. It automates a few
processes, and generally simplifies working with Phoenix WebSockets.

Once you have installed the package, and followed the simple setup instructions
[here](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/phollyer/elm-phoenix-websocket/latest/),
configuring this module is as simple as this:

    import Phoenix
    import Ports.Phoenix as Ports


    -- Add the Phoenix Model to your Model

    type alias Model =
        { phoenix : Phoenix.Model
            ...
        }


    -- Initialize the Phoenix Model

    init : Model
    init =
        { phoenix = Phoenix.init Ports.config
            ...
        }


    -- Add a Phoenix Msg

    type Msg
        = PhoenixMsg Phoenix.Msg
        | ...


    -- Handle Phoenix Msgs

    update : Msg -> Model -> (Model Cmd Msg)
    update msg model =
        case msg of
            PhoenixMsg subMsg ->
                let
                    (phoenix, phoenixCmd, phoenixMsg) =
                        Phoenix.update subMsg model.phoenix
                in
                case phoenixMsg of
                    ...

                _ ->
                    ({ model | phoenix = phoenix }
                    , Cmd.map PhoenixMsg phoenixCmd
                    )

            _ ->
                (model, Cmd.none)


    -- Subscribe to receive Phoenix Msgs

    subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
    subscriptions model =
        Sub.map PhoenixMsg <|
            Phoenix.subscriptions model.phoenix

# Pushing

When pushing an event to a Channel, opening the Socket, and joining the
Channel is handled automatically. Pushes will be queued until the Channel has
been joined, at which point, any queued pushes will be sent in a batch.

See [Connecting to the Socket](#connecting-to-the-socket) and
[Joining a Channel](#joining-a-channel) for more details on handling connecting
and joining manually.

If the Socket is open and the Channel already joined, the push will be sent
immediately.

@docs RetryStrategy, PushConfig, pushConfig, push


# Subscriptions

@docs subscriptions


# Connecting to the Socket

Connecting to the Socket is automatic on the first [push](#push) to a Channel,
and also when a [join](#join) is attempted. However, if it is necessary to
connect before hand, the [connect](#connect) function is available.

@docs connect


## Setting connect options

@docs addConnectOptions, setConnectOptions


## Sending data when connecting

@docs setConnectParams


# Disconnecting from the Socket

@docs disconnect, disconnectAndReset


# Joining a Channel

Joining a Channel is automatic on the first [push](#push) to the Channel.
However, if it is necessary to join before hand, the [join](#join) function is
available.

@docs join, joinAll, JoinConfig, joinConfig, setJoinConfig


# Leaving a Channel

@docs leave, leaveAll, LeaveConfig, setLeaveConfig


# Incoming Events

Setting up incoming events to receive on a Channel can be done when setting a
[JoinConfig](#JoinConfig), but if it is necessary to switch events on and off
intermittently, then the following functions are available.

@docs addEvent, addEvents, dropEvent, dropEvents


# Helpers


## Socket Information

@docs socketState, socketStateToString, isConnected, connectionState, disconnectReason, endPointURL, protocol


## Channels

@docs queuedChannels, channelQueued, joinedChannels, channelJoined, topicParts


## Pushes

@docs allQueuedPushes, queuedPushes, pushQueued, dropQueuedPush

@docs pushInFlight, pushWaiting

@docs timeoutPushes, pushTimedOut, dropTimeoutPush, pushTimeoutCountdown

@docs dropPush


## Presence Information

@docs presenceState, presenceDiff, presenceJoins, presenceLeaves, lastPresenceJoin, lastPresenceLeave


## Batching

@docs batch, batchWithParams


## Logging

Here you can log data to the console, and activate and deactive the socket's
logger, but be warned, **there is no safeguard when you compile** such as you
get when you use `Debug.log`. Be sure to deactive the logging before you deploy
to production.

However, the ability to easily toggle logging on and off leads to a possible
use case where, in a deployed production environment, an admin is able to see
all the logging, while regular users do not.

    [Json.Encode.null](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Encode#null).
    Defaults to
    [Json.Encode.null](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Encode#null).

  - `events` - A list of events to receive from the Channel. Defaults to `[]`.

  - `timeout` - Optional timeout, in ms, before retrying to join if the previous
    attempt failed. Defaults to `Nothing`.

If a `JoinConfig` is not set prior to joining a Channel, the defaults will be used.

    data, set this to
    [Json.Encode.null](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Encode#null).

  - `timeout` - Optional timeout in milliseconds to set on the push request.

  - `retryStrategy` - The retry strategy to use if the push times out.

  - `ref` - Optional reference that can later be used to identify the push.
    This is useful when using functions that need to find the push in order to
    do their thing, such as [dropPush](#dropPush) or
    [pushTimeoutCountdown](#pushTimeoutCountdown).

  - `Drop` - Drop the push and don't try again. This is the default if no
    strategy is set.

  - `Every second` - The number of seconds to wait between retries.

  - `Backoff [List seconds] (Maybe max)` - A backoff strategy enabling you to increase
    the delay between retries. When the list has been exhausted, `max` will be
    used for each subsequent attempt, if max is `Nothing`, the push will then
    be dropped, which is useful if you want to limit the number of retries.

{-| A type alias representing a Presence on a Channel.

  - `id` - The `id` used to identify the Presence map in the
    [Presence.track/3](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html#c:track/3)
    Elixir function. The recommended approach is to use the users' `id`.

  - `metas`- A list of metadata as stored in the
    [Presence.track/3](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html#c:track/3)
    function.

  - `user` - The user data that is pulled from the DB and stored on the
    Presence in the
    [fetch/2](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html#c:fetch/2)
    Elixir callback function. This is the recommended approach for storing user
    data on the Presence. If
    [fetch/2](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html#c:fetch/2) is
    not being used then `user` will be equal to
    [Json.Encode.null](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/json/latest/Json-Encode#null).

  - `presence` - The whole Presence map. This provides a way to access any
    additional data that is stored on the Presence.

```

def handle_info(:after_join, socket) do
  {:ok, _} = Presence.track(socket, socket.assigns.user_id, %{
